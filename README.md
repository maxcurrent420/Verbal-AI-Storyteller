### Limitations/Bugs

* **Resource Management:** The current implementation can be resource-intensive, especially when using voice cloning and image generation, and might experience performance issues with resource constraints.
* **Robustness:** The codebase is under development, and there might be unexpected behaviors or crashes.
* **Speech Recognition:** The current speech recognition component may not be as accurate for all voices and accents. 
* **Audio Quality:** The audio generated by some voice models may vary in quality.

### Development Roadmap

* **Optimize Resource Management:** Implement efficient resource management techniques to improve performance and minimize memory usage. 
* **Error Handling and Logging:** Improve error handling and logging for better debugging and diagnostics.
* **Enhance Speech Recognition Accuracy:**  Investigate alternative speech recognition libraries or models for improved accuracy.
* **Audio Quality Control:**  Explore methods to improve audio quality for different voice models and styles.
* **Multi-Genre Storytelling:**  Expand the repertoire of story scenarios with additional genres and customizable settings. 
* **Customizable Character Voices:**  Allow users to select different character voices, potentially adding voice cloning capabilities for each character.
* **Improved Image Generation:**  Implement more advanced image generation techniques for higher quality and more visually appealing scenes.
* **Story Integration with Other APIs:**  Explore integrating with other APIs to enhance the storytelling experience (e.g., weather data, historical facts, location information).
* **User Interface Enhancements:**  Refine the Gradio user interface for a more seamless and intuitive user experience.
* **Documentation and Testing:**  Enhance the program's documentation and implement more comprehensive testing for improved reliability.

### Usage

#1. **Install Requirements:**  Make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed. You can install them with:

#   ```bash
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#   ```

#2. **Setup Environment Variables:**
#   * **GROQ_API_KEY:**  Set the `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable to your Groq API key if you plan on using Groq for LLM generation. You can find your Groq API key in your Groq account settings. 
#   * **Local LLM Setup (Optional):** If you are using a local LLM server, ensure it is running and set the `BASE_URL` environment variable to your LLM server's base URL. You might also need to adjust the `API_KEY` variable in `aimodels/llm_models.py` depending on your LLM setup.

#3. **Run the Program:**

#   ```bash
#   python main.py 
#   ```

#4. **Interact with the Interface:**
#   * **Choose a Scenario:**  Select a pre-defined scenario (Thriller) or input your own custom scenario in the provided text box.
#   * **Select a Voice Model:** Choose from different voice models, including OpenVoice, xttsv2, yourtts, or UnrealSpeech.
#   * **Select LLM Source:** Choose between "Local" (using your local LLM server) or "Groq" (using the Groq API).
#   * **Reference Audio (Optional):** Upload audio to clone the voice of the story with your own voice. This will personalize the narration with your voice.
#   * **Voice Style:** Select a specific voice style (e.g., whispering, cheerful, angry) for the story's narration.
#   * **Enable Image Generation:**  Enable this option to see AI-generated images of the story scenes.
#   * **Start Story:** Click the "Start Story" button to begin your adventure. 
#   * **Speak your Choices:** The game will listen to your voice commands.  Choose from the options presented to advance the story.

### Functionality Overview

#### Voice Cloning

#The application uses OpenVoice for voice cloning, allowing you to create a unique voice for the story based on a reference audio recording. When you upload reference audio, the application analyzes its characteristics and uses them to synthesize a similar voice for the narration.

#### Image Generation

#With image generation enabled, the application utilizes an AI model (in this case, Segmind API) to generate images based on the story's scenes. The LLM will provide descriptions of the scenes, and the image generation service will create corresponding images.

#### Mem0 Integration

#Mem0 is a lightweight in-memory database used to store and retrieve story details and bookmarks. This ensures persistence and allows you to save and load your progress, including story details and bookmarks, across different sessions.

#### Bookmarking

#The application provides bookmarking functionality that allows you to save the current state of the story at any point. This includes saving the current scenario, the story's progress (messages), and the last LLM response, so you can resume your adventure from where you left off.

### Code Structure

#* **main.py:**  The main entry point for the application. Initializes the Gradio interface and starts the story service.
#* **ui/gradio_interface.py:**  Contains the Gradio UI code, defining the user interface elements and their interactions.
#* **services:**  A directory containing various service modules:
#    * **story_service.py:**  Handles the logic for generating the story, managing messages, and interacting with the LLM.
#    * **audio_service.py:**  Responsible for generating and playing audio, using the selected voice model and style.
#    * **image_service.py:**  Handles the image generation process, utilizing the Segmind API.
#    * **bookmarks.py:**  Manages bookmarks for saving and loading progress in the story.
#* **aimodels:**  A directory containing code for AI models:
#    * **llm_models.py:**  Defines different LLM models (LocalLLMModel and GroqLLMModel) for generating responses.
#    * **tts_models.py:**  Contains code for TTS models, including OpenVoiceModel.

### Deployment

#You can deploy the application using Docker. Create a Dockerfile with the following contents:

#```dockerfile
#FROM python:3.9

#WORKDIR /app

#COPY requirements.txt ./
#RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

#COPY . .

#EXPOSE 7860

#CMD ["python", "main.py"]
#```

#Then, build the Docker image:

#```bash
#docker build -t choose-your-own-adventure .
#```

#Finally, run the container:

#```bash
#docker run -p 7860:7860 choose-your-own-adventure
#```

### Example

#1. Run the application: `python main.py`
#2. Choose "Thriller" scenario.
#3. Select "OpenVoice" for the voice model.
#4. Choose "Local" for the LLM source. 
#5. Leave reference audio empty.
#6. Select "cheerful" as the voice style.
#7. Click "Start Story".
#8. You'll hear the welcome message: "Welcome to the Infinite A I ReActive Experience. Are you ready to begin your #adventure? Say 'Start' when you're ready."
#9. Speak "Start". 
#10. The story will continue based on your spoken choices.

#Enjoy your immersive adventure!
